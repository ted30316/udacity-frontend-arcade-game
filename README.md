## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

How to play the game:

The basic concept of the game is to get to navigate Droopy from one end of the grass to the other, without getting ran over by the enemies aka dump trucks.  Droopy can move left, right, up and down with arrow keys.  The dump trucks move at various speeds all throughout the scenes.  When a dump truck collides with Droopy, the game is reset and Droopy moves back to the start of the grass.  Once Droopy reaches the other side of the grass successfully, the game is WON!
